# Blind 75 Daily Solutions Repository

Welcome to the Blind 75 Daily Solutions Repository! The Blind 75 list is a curated set of coding problems commonly asked during technical interviews at top tech companies.

## Problem Solving

Each day, a new problem from the Blind 75 list is solved and added to this repository. Solutions are provided in both Java and C++ programming languages to cater to developers who prefer either language. The solutions are carefully crafted and optimized to demonstrate efficient problem-solving techniques and best practices.

## Organization

The repository is organized into directories for each programming language: `java` for Java solutions and `cpp` for C++ solutions. Within each language directory, the solutions are further organized into subdirectories based on the problem number or category.

### Java Solutions
- `java/probname_daynumber`: Solutions to Blind 75 problems in Java.
- Additional subdirectories may be present for specific categories or topics.

### C++ Solutions
- `cpp/probname_daynumber`: Solutions to Blind 75 problems in C++, following the same structure as Java solutions.
- Similar additional subdirectories may be included for specific categories or topics.
